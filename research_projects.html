Morphogenesis of vertebrate organs is initiated by asymmetrical deformation. Counter-clockwise rotation of the previously straight gut tube enables the intestine to achieve its familiar twisted form. Gut rotation hinges on the neighboring dorsal mesentery (DM), a tissue bridge anchoring the gut tube. The left and right sides of the mesentery are physically continuous but exhibit discrete and asymmetric tissue changes, causing the mesentery to deform and tilt the attached gut tube leftward; this provides a critical bias to initiate rotation that is conserved throughout evolution. These events are orchestrated by the transcription factor Pitx2, which is expressed on the left side of embryos. Pitx2 expression is induced during gastrulation by Nodal signaling, a conserved morphogen that is transient and disappears before asymmetric organogenesis. Yet, Pitx2 expression persists in all asymmetric organs including the mesentery, leaving unresolved how left-right patterning information is transferred from early gastrulation to downstream organ morphogenesis. I found that mesentery deformation was driven by a second wave of Pitx2 expression, independent of Nodal signaling. Using modern approaches to chicken embryology, mouse genetics and gut explants, I found that intestinal rotation instead required a local amplification and tuning of Pitx2 expression by a new player - a latent TGFß mechanosensory signaling module. By pioneering techniques to measure and manipulate tissue mechanics in the embryonic DM, I found that tilting forces from right side (acts as accelerator) were sensed and mechanically transduced into TGFß-dependent Pitx2 expression changes in the neighboring left DM, resulting in polarized mesenchymal condensation and increased tissue stiffness (acts as brake). This system reproducibly rotates the vertebrate intestine to prevent fatal intestinal obstructions.  These findings address a long-standing question of how asymmetric organs interpret the embryonic body plan to execute local programs of laterality.
