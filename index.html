        I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://kurpioslab.vet.cornell.edu/"> Dr. Natasza Kurpios' lab</a> and the <a href="https://bmcb.cornell.edu/">field of biochemistry, molecular and cell biology</a> at Cornell university. 
<br><br>I am facinated by the systems-level accuracy and precision with which organisms are engineered. In my current work, I am trying to understand how the intestine obtains its characteristic structures and functions during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. I use a wide range of techniques spanning single-cell transcriptomics, mouse genetics and physiology, modern approaches to chicken embryology, high-resolution/ 3D imaging, measurement and manipulation of gene expression, cell signaling and tissue mechanics.
