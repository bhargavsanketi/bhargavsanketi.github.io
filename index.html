        I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://kurpioslab.vet.cornell.edu/"> Dr. Natasza Kurpios' lab</a> and the <a href="https://bmcb.cornell.edu/">field of biochemistry, molecular and cell biology</a> at Cornell university in <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/photos-images/ithaca-ny.html">gorge-ous Ithaca, New York</a>. I previously earned an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in/"> RV College of Engineering, India</a>.
<br><br>I am facinated by the systems-level accuracy and precision with which organisms are engineered. In my current work, I am trying to understand how the intestine obtains its characteristic structures and functions during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. I use a wide range of techniques spanning single-cell transcriptomics, mouse genetics and physiology, modern approaches to chicken embryology, high-resolution/ 3D imaging, measurement and manipulation of gene expression, cell signaling and tissue mechanics.

<br><br>I believe that science is for everyone and vice versa - I achieve this through evidence-based approaches to teaching, mentoring and learning in diverse environments, science communication and advocacy. 
            <br><br>When not in lab, you can find me cooking, hiking or watching films with my better-half and our dog Central ('Dog'-ma).
