        I am currently a senior scientist at <a href="http://altoslabs.com/">Altos labs</a> at their San Diego institute of science. I previously earned a Ph.D. in Cell biology from Cornell university, New York and an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology engineering from RV College of Engineering, India.
<br><br>I am facinated by the systems-level accuracy and precision with which organisms are engineered. In my current work, I am trying to understand how aging and fibrosis affects tissue homeostasis and exploring cellular reprogramming as an approach to reverse these decline. Previously, I studied how the intestine obtains its characteristic structures and functions during embryonic development and adult homeostasis.
