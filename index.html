        I am currently a senior scientist at <a href="http://altoslabs.com/">Altos labs</a> at their San Diego institute of science, advised by  <a href="https://www.altoslabs.com/team/juan-carlos-izpisua-belmonte"> Dr. Juan Carlos Belmonte </a>. I was previously a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="http://kurpioslab.vet.cornell.edu/"> Dr. Natasza Kurpios' lab</a> and the <a href="https://bmcb.cornell.edu/">field of biochemistry, molecular and cell biology</a> at Cornell university, New York</a>. I previously earned an undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from <a href="https://www.rvce.edu.in/"> RV College of Engineering, India</a>.
<br><br>I am facinated by the systems-level accuracy and precision with which organisms are engineered. In my current work, I am trying to understand how aging and fibrosis affects tissue homeostasis and exploring cellular reprogramming as an approach to reverse these decline. Previously, I studied how the intestine obtains its characteristic structures and functions during embryonic development and adult homeostasis.
